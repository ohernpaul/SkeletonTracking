# Humanoid Detection and Skeleton Landmarks

### Description
This notebook is a demonstration of applied AI using a pre-trained model to:

- Detect the presence of a **humanoid subject** with a degree of confidence
- Identify and localize **skeleton key landmarks** across the body

The goal of this study is to evaluate potential tools for the downstream task of **Automatic Rigging of 3D Humanoid Models** for animation or game pipelines.
